# SpecFlow and Selenium Mini Project

### Project Aim

The aim of this project is to create an automated testing framework for a given website by using tools such as SpecFlow and Selenium. In this project, we will convert business specifications into gherkin syntax, and then apply Behaviour-Driven-Development techniques to test the website. This method of automated testing is beneficial in an agile work environment as it provides significant time and cost reductions in the long term.

Selenium is a portable framework that allows us to automate browsers, it is often for testing web applications. SpecFlow is used to define, manage and automatically execute human-readable acceptance tests in .NET projects. We can use these tools in collaboration to automatically test our specifications against the web application.

### Project Review

We created an automated testing framework for the website "https://www.saucedemo.com/index.html". Page Object Modelling (POM) was a crucial technique for setting up the framework as it allowed us to treat elements of a page as C# objects within a class. 

The main challenges faced in this project were mainly to do with GitHub collaboration and resolving merge conflicts. However, after some practice it became second nature for team members to ensure everybody is working on up to date versions of the project, in the appropriate feature branches.

### Project Retrospective

This project was considerably short and we were able to overcome challenges quickly. This was because the team members were experienced and familiar in creating web testing frameworks using the aforementioned tools.
